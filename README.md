Ever wonder how often your phone is gathering location information? Wonder no more! 
This android application (name to be determined) passively listens for any location
requests applications make with your phone, and records them in a database. These location
requests can be viewed geographically on a map, or in graph form (where a time range can be
specified for viewing on the map).  In addition, the application provides simple aggregate
information for the selected time range, such as total number of requests and average 
location request interval.


-Passively monitors and records (and displays on a map) the location fixes made on your Android phone.
