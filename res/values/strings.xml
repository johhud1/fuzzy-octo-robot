    <string name="first_time_mapview_message">Welcome to Passive Location Monitor. This is the map view, where location \
        requests are marked by their geographic position. Each location request is placed on the map as its own marker, unless there
        were several requests nearby in a small time-frame, in which case the requests are merged into one marker, and the number of merged \
        requests is noted in the marker callout</string>

    <string name="welcome">Welcome</string>
    <string name="first_time_timeview_message">This is the time graph view. The number of requests per hour is graphed here. \
        Its likely there are no requests recorded yet, so this screen will be blank. Once there are, you can select \
        a time range to display in the map view by clicking on the graph or dragging the dark squares.</string>
