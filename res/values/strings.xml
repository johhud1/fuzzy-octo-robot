    <string name="first_time_mapview_message">Welcome to PassiveLocationTracker. This is the map view, where location \
        requests are marked by their geographic position. Each location request is placed on the map as its own marker, unless there
        were several requests nearby in a small time-frame, in which case the requests are merged into one marker, and the number of merged \
        requests is noted in the marker callout</string>
